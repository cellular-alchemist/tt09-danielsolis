  author: "Daniel Solis"

  description: >-
    An on-chip implementation of a Hopfield neural network using Izhikevich-type regular spiking (RS) 
    and fast spiking (FS) neurons with on-chip Hebbian learning. The design features a 7-neuron network 
    with real-time pattern storage and retrieval capabilities. Each neuron implements the Izhikevich model, 
    known for its computational efficiency and biological accuracy. The system includes:
    - 7 spiking neurons with configurable parameters
    - On-chip Hebbian learning for weight adaptation
    - 4-bit pattern input for storing patterns
    - 7-bit spike output for pattern retrieval
    - Area-optimized implementation using fixed-point arithmetic
    - Sequential processing for resource efficiency
    Applications include pattern recognition, associative memory, and neuromorphic computing demonstrations.
